#Overview

* spec - Generate DCT spectrums for viewing or invertible spectrums for editing in a regular image editor.
* motion - 3-dimensional frequency-space editor for video.
* applybasis - Tools for working with basis functions of a variety of 2D transforms.
* zoom - Interpolate images against a cosine basis.

# Dependencies
Most tools in this framework depend on [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org), [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org), and/or [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org).

# Building
Running

	make

From the top level will build each project.

# TODO
